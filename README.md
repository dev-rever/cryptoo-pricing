# Welcome to Cryptoo Pricing

[繁體中文](http://cryptoo-pricing.com/readme.zh)

## Introduction

This is my first backend project built with Go. It serves as a practice exercise for designing backend architecture, implementing core features, and handling production deployment.

The system includes user registration and login, along with JWT-based authentication. Cryptocurrency data is retrieved using the free public API provided by [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/).

As this is a beginner-level project, there may be room for improvement. Any feedback or suggestions are greatly appreciated — thank you!
